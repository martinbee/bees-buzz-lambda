AWS lambda used to fetch articles for Bees Buzz News Hub

## Plan

[X] Use AWS for secrets
[X] Get data from apis/scrape and then data marshall
[X] Log data

[] Use Cloudwatch events to trigger this cron job every morning
[] Eventually store in AWS DB (which one?)
[] We need to delete older entries (new cron job? clear on this cron job?)
